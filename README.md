This project is how I automate scheduling tweets for the Twitter account @mtgoupdate and its spinoffs @mtgoupdate_eu and (coming soon!) @mtgoupdate_jp. These accounts broadcast information about tournaments held on Magic the Gathering: Online, including regularly scheduled weekly tournaments as well as special one-off events. This information is difficult to find in convenient places anywhere else, and the accounts collectively have nearly 1000 followers.
